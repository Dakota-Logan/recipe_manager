				kitchen
				at home
				AND
				in a
				professional
				setting.
				This is
				the MVP version 1.0.0. Yes! It is very new! Feature may be lacking but i believe, given a bit of time, this will transform into a fully
				functional application! Will a bit of effort and a lot of google, I will eventually create something usable.</p>
